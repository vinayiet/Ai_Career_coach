# 🤖 AI Career Coach — Personalized Career Guidance from Your Resume

## 🧩 Problem Statement

In today’s fast-evolving tech landscape, students and early-career professionals often face confusion about how to shape their career paths effectively. Most struggle with questions like:

- *"Which tech role suits me based on what I already know?"*
- *"What specific skills or projects should I learn or build next?"*
- *"Am I industry-ready for roles like Machine Learning Engineer or Backend Developer?"*
- *"What are the latest trends and interview expectations for my target role?"*

While tools like ChatGPT can provide generic career suggestions, they fall short when it comes to **personalized guidance**. Copy-pasting resumes manually limits understanding and results in vague, irrelevant advice.

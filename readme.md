## 📈 Progress Tracking – How It Works

* Each roadmap task is tagged with:

  * `task_id`
  * `date_assigned`
  * `resource_link`
  * `completion_status` (student-updated)
* Weekly quizzes auto-generated from roadmap content
* Dashboard shows progress % and engagement trends
* Alerts for uncompleted tasks beyond 48 hours

---

## 📬 Daily Reminders Logic

1. User uploads resume and selects a role.
2. AI generates a 30-day roadmap.
3. Each day, a cron job/email scheduler sends:

    * Today’s topic
    * Resource links
    * Quick challenge or quiz
4. System waits for student feedback (done/not done).

## 🧠 Ideas to Implement...

* 🔄 Feedback Loop: After 15 days, re-analyze progress and dynamically tweak the roadmap.
* 📊 Analytics for colleges: Track how many students are preparing for each role.
* 🧩 Plugin for LinkedIn scraping to match current trends versus resume skills.
* 🎯 Adaptive Learning: Faster learners get advanced topics early.
* 🤝 Mentor Matchmaking: Recommend available seniors based on roadmap overlap.

## 🚀 Deployment Plan

* Backend: Render / Railway
* Frontend: Vercel / Netlify
* Database: Supabase / Firebase / MongoDB Atlas
* LLMs: OpenAI or self-hosted on Hugging Face
* Email: SendGrid or Mailgun with background worker (Celery / APScheduler)
